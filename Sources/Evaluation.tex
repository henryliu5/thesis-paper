Figure \ref{Eval: Throughput} compares the throughput of our system using different cache replacement policies and mechanisms.
...

Although there is little discernable difference in throughput between the lock-free and R/W lock approaches, there is an impact on P99 latency. Figure \ref{Eval: P99 latency} demonstrates these differences.
Note the log scale.
